📌 Project Overview

This project is a fully functional Chess Game developed using Core Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures, and Swing GUI.
It simulates a real chess match between two players with essential and advanced chess rules implemented.

The application focuses on clean architecture, real-world Java practices, and interactive gameplay, making it suitable for academic projects, interviews, and portfolio showcases.

🚀 Key Features
♟️ Core Gameplay

Two-player chess game (White vs Black)

Fully interactive 8×8 chessboard

Turn-based play with rule enforcement

Real chess movement rules for all pieces

🎨 GUI & UX

Java Swing based GUI

Chess piece icons instead of text

Valid move highlighting (Green)

Capture indication (Red square)

Undo & Redo functionality

Clean and responsive UI

⏱️ Game Controls

All opponent pieces are eliminated

Board disables automatically after game over

🔁 Move Management

Undo last move

Redo undone move

Abstraction (Piece hierarchy)

Inheritance (Pawn, Rook, Knight, etc.)

Polymorphism (isValidMove() overrides)

Encapsulation (Board & Piece state handling)

🧮 Data Structures

Stack for Undo/Redo operations

2D Array for board representation

🖥️ GUI

Java Swing (JFrame, JButton, JPanel)

Event-driven programming

Custom UI updates

🔌 Database

JDBC

DAO pattern

MySQL Workbench
